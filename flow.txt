Component Flow Discussion: 2020-04-09: Bart, Mike, Jack, Peter

1. The flow representation (define-flow, etc) DSL should be hacked upon to make
it more amenable for manipulation by the gamedev and possibly at runtime.
Currently it is a little hard to understand and requires some hardcoded
knowledge about the states and their backing data structures.

Mike: The flows are large and hard to understand, can it be reimagined to be
easier to learn, manage, maintain, and manipulate. Try to fix the syntax such
that M-. works when moving between states. Navigation is very difficult
currently.

Pete: I'm interested in allowing the gamedev access to the component flow so
they can add new states, move things around, have different flows for different
reasons, add new protocol methods if desired, etc, etc, etc.

Bart: No general comments about define-flow DSL at this time.

Jack & Pete: Ensure stable and defined behavior for all components and actors,
especially with things like collision handling and actors getting enabled and
disabled. Don't repeat Unity/Unreal's semantic problems with their flows.

NOTE: The representation of the DSL is generally orthogonal to the behavior
of its internals and can be hacked upon seperately.

NOTE: Should we complete the Graph DSL and use THAT to represent the flows and
their states? The Graph DSL is a chunk of work, but isolated.


2. The protocols:


[current state] -> (requests) => [next state]



Component Protocol
------------------
# record on-component-pre-render when we get here. Maybe multiple methods that
# somehow get sorted?

enterable state looks like: <collision system, networking, audio, etc>
# The gamedev "uses" a enterable state by implementing this protocol for their
# component. THe gmedev could supply an ordering for the dispatch calls.
# Example for the collider. (See Notes)
(on-enter :collision (self collider) <enterable-descriptor>)

(on-continue :collision (self collider) <enterable-descriptor>)
(on-exit :collision (self collider) <enterable-descriptor>)


# protocol methods
make-component
<make-instance>
<reinitialize-instance> (set prefab information)
on-component-initialize
on-component-attach
on-component-enable
<enter enterable states>
<stay in enterable states>
on-component-update
on-component-physics-update


# REALLY IMPORTANT to manage. Gamedev somehow gets this into the Engine.
# We are going to make our own method qualifiers.
# Don't allow gamedev to call this at runtime!
# Get put into the example boiler plate code that the "make-project" call makes.
# This is probably a macro which generates the CL necesary to add
# quaifiers to the specified methods.
# User may have to restart image when changing this.
# Don't break :before/:after stuff for this.
#
# NOTE: When we want to call this method, the FLOWS know to call the :pre
# version first across the typedag, THEN the :default is invoked across
# the typedag
(define-protocol-hook-order v:on-component-render (:pre :default :post))

# Maybe make our own dispatch function? (Which doesn't break :before/:after)
# Possibly convert to defprotocol and we can control it ourselves.
(defmethod v:on-component-render :pre (self component)
  nil)

(defmethod v:on-component-render :default (self component)
  nil)

(defmethod v:on-component-render :post (self component)
  nil)



# First, run this on ALL components (that define this method)
(defmethod v:on-component-disable :pre (self component)
  nil)

# Then, (in the flows) run this on ALL component (that define this method)
(defmethod v:on-component-disable :default (self component)
  nil)


on-component-disable
<exit enterable states>
on-component-update-when-disabled
on-component-physics-update-when-disabled
on-component-detach
on-component-destroy

Component Semantic Constraint Rules
-----------------------------------
Any created actors/components should all enter the scene tree before the frame.


Component Dependency Constraint Rules
-------------------------------------
TODO


Actor Protocol
--------------

<user API>

make-actor
spawn-actor
set-parent (not currently implemented)
destroy (for actors and components)

;; Notes from mfiano:
;; When destroying an ACTOR, we have a lot of complex things we may want to do.
;; We should discuss whether or not we want each of these on a case-by-case
;; basi. This is a non-exhaustive list so far:
;;
;; 1) When an actor is ACTUALLY destroyed, delete the children sub-tree of that
;; actor entirely.
;;
;; 2) When an actor is ACTUALLY destroyed, reparent its children as direct
;; children of its parent.
;;
;; 3) During predestroy, if an actor spawned a new child, allow user to specify
;; if that new actor is destroyed or not during case #1 above.
;;
;; 4) During the TTL (before predestroy state), if an actor spawned a new child,
;; allow user to specify that new actor is destroyed or not during case #1
;; above.
;;
;; 5) When an actor is ACTUALLY destroyed, leave it's children sub-tree as a
;; floating sub-tree that is not connected to the scene tree anymore, but is
;; possible for the user to splice it in somewhere later.

Prefab Connection

NOTES
-----

Enterable States:
[tentative to control orering of protocol methods independent of the typedaag]

If the enterable protocol was made its own dispatch system, we could do things
like:

(defmethod on-collision-enter :collision (a b c d) ...)
(defmethod on-audio-enter :audio (a b c d) ..))

and then tell the MOP that when entering the enterable states, we must call
the methods like:

Enter -> (:collision :audio)
Stay -> (:collision :audio)
Enter -> (:audio :collision)

# possible idea for enterable protocol (think about read/write/exception
# callbacks for networking, and other enterable states that might notify
# us of things beyonf the simple collision example.

(defmethod on-enter :collision ((self collider) enterable-context))
(defmethod on-continue :collision ((self collider) enterable-context))
(defmethod on-exit :collision ((self collider) enterable-context))

Keyword dispatch symbols are reserved for Virality. Otherwise could be
symbols used in contrib modules.

Threading:
Use it in MINIMAL cases where it is clearly useful (network, audio,
file loading, etc) and in general, don't provide any threading interface to
the gamedev. Use it in the deeper layers.


CLOS Filter dispatch system:
  Can help us design the Component Protocol.
  Inspect performance of it too, can we use it gradually?
  Michael Fiano suggests:
    http://www.p-cos.net/documents/filtered-dispatch.pdf
    https://github.com/pcostanza/filtered-functions


Think about passing a reason for why the component protocol is being invoked,
like, should a disable KNOW it is being called due to its actor being disabled
or just because disable was called by some other component?


To help test all of this stuff, write a component that can be used to stress
test the engine by slowly increasing the number of actors with colliders
and/or other features that use the engine. As time progressing, it adds more
stress and we can watch a profile of the engine to see what happens.



Jack: How do we deal with this situation:
1. destroy component (ttl <- 0)
2. moves to disable.
3. on-component-disable makes a request to re-enable self.
3. moves to detach because (ttl is still 0)
4. on-component-detach sets ttl to NIL
5. component stays in detached instead of being destroyed.
6. Now there is a "enable component" request to process, but the component has
   been disconnected from the actor, what do we do?

---

1. broadcast a "phase change" of :on-will-destroy to an actor (and desc)
2. gamedev put a hook in for (on-component-phase-change :on-will-destroy) and
   executes whatever code is required for this phase change.
3. destroy walks through its standard provess of destroying actors, components,
   and all children. Suppose we make it down to detached for a component.
4. on-component-detach changes ttl to nil or greater than zero.
5. ?? What happens ?? What do we do?
6. Do we somehow detect we're being destroyed and prevent the TTL function
   from altering the ttl? Like, TTL notices the states and prevents/allows it.

Pete suggests to fix the above problems (and probably others):
"If TTL EVER goes to zero, that is automatically the crossing of
the event horizon into destruction and the TTL accessor refuses to change it
away from 0 forever." Maybe (setf TTL) returns a values of the ttl and if it
was modifiable.


Jack: How can we determine a request is invalid?


Result of meeting: 2020-04-10

async requests (make-actor, make-component, reparent, actor-enable,
component-disable, etc) are pushed onto a stack/queue with cursors, and when a
request is processed any new requests generated are pushed at the most relevant
cursor position.

<end>[cursor][recompilations][cursor][update phase][physics-update phase]...
.....[cursor][collision detection][physics]<head> <- process here.



Result of meeting: 2020-04-11

Mfiano: If there are twn instances of FOO component, a 5 of them use material
M, then when M gets recompiled, ONLY THOSE 5 instances should get an
"on-material-recompile" callback. This implies their are data structures
or functions that go into components to test if they are applicable to get
that event.
