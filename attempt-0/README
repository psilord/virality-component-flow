The Actor/Component Flow Refactor

Problem:

The current actor/component flow is missing desired user protocol functions
and has missing functionality and errors with the current implementation.
One error for example is if you create a new component in the
on-component-initialize method, it will be forgotten about by the system
and ignored.

Actor State Machine:


Components State Machine:

A component will go through this state machine

on-component-initialize
on-component-attach
on-component-enable
on-component-physics-update
on-component-update
on-component-disable
on-component-detach
on-component-destroy
